# Zillow-Housing-Price-Prediction
Predict house price using geography information, age, area and so on.

The algorithm I used includes XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest and so on. Then, I use simple weight average method to ensemble the models we learnt.

There are three files in this repo:

- **Original Data** : Contains the train and test data set.

- **Geography Data** : Contains the geography data crawling through Google Map API.

- **Zillow.ipynb** : This ducument is divided into three parts:
  - **Data Preparation**
  - **Modelling**
  - **Prediction**


If you want to know the detail of this project, feel free to look through all the files.
